title: Victor for USU
author: Victor Zhang
abstract: I'm Victor Zhang and this is where you'll find my full policy statement for my 2023 campaign for USU board. I'm here to listen to what you need and what you would like the USU to be. Though, that doesn't make much of a campaign. I believe the USU should be firmly committed to bettering the welfare of students whever possible, through initiatives to ease the cost of living crisis like FoodHub or doing better for students with disabilities by mandating disabilities awareness training and advocating for the continuation of hybrid learning, just to name two examples. Also, you might be wondering, why does this look like a LaTeX document. I find it quite charming and I really like it if I just get the information I need without fuss.

<p class="Section">About Me</p>
    <p class="BodyText">I'm Victor Zhang, studying a Bachelors of Engineering (Mechatronics). I'm currently a councillor on the 95th SRC and am a Director of Student Publications on the SRC. Though, I'll be honest, for a good chunk of my time at university, I didn't care about stupol. I didn't feel like I was being heard at all and there really wasn't that much effort being made to engage me as a STEM student in stupol. Come each election season be it for USU or SRC, the PNR building is devoid of campaigners clustered around corflutes wielding HTVs and flyers. I'd like that to be different. Maybe not the bit about corflutes and flyers, but most definitely the part about engaging STEM students in student politics.

<p class="Section">Cost of Living: FoodHub</p>
    <p class="BodyText">With the number of students using the FoodHub services this semester
        reaching into the thousands, it is clear that more and more are affected by
        the cost-of-living crisis. The uptick in demand and my personal experiences
        volunteering for FoodHub indicates just how necessary this service is. While
        FoodHub is funded by the USU, the administrative duties fall to the vicepresidents of the SRC. Importantly, the regulations of the SRC do not
        mandate that this is their responsibility, in effect their efforts are <em>unpaid</em>.
        Such a vital and necessary service should not fall entirely onto volunteer
        work.</p>
    <ul class="BodyText">
        <li>The USU should create a permanent position where a USU staff 
            member takes over the administrative duties of FoodHub</li>
        <li>The operating hours and operating days of FoodHub should be
            expanded from the current 1000-1400 on Tuesdays and Thursday to ideally every weekday</li>
    </ul>

<p class="Section">Cost of Living: Free Food Initiatives</p>
    <p class="BodyText">With the cost-of-living crisis there is also ample demand for ready meals
        and drinks on campus in addition to the pantry staples provided by
        FoodHub. To this effort the USU is currently running the Student Savers
        program to alleviate some stress from students facing this crisis. This
        initiative should be expanded.</p>
    <ul class="BodyText">
        <li>The USU should affirm and continue the current efforts of the Student Savers program</li>
        <li>The free breakfast and coffee from the USU Student Savers should
            be expanded from monthly to at least fortnightly</li>
    </ul>

<p class="Section">Better Feedback Mechanisms</p>
    <p class="BodyText">Much has been said over the years about increased transparency of the USU. While efforts have been made to increase transparency (published meeting minutes, presidents reports, etc.), this counts for nothing if students are not part of the process. The USU should leverage its existing reach to be able to quickly gauge what students needs are. For example, changes proposed by key decision making bodies in the university or by state or federal governments that can affect students should be polled to students via mechanisms such as an email referendum. Such feedback mechanisms can also be used to provide a ‘temperature check’ on how students are feeling about their experiences here and whether they feel that they are adequately represented.</p>
    <p class="BodyText">At the end of the day we are here to represent you, and this is a vital step to ensuring that.</p>
    <p class="BodyText">While the argument could be made that this is much more suited to the SRC, we cannot ignore the fact that the USU simply has more reach than the SRC (one only need look at the difference in SSAF funding). On these matters both organisations should cooperate to gather concrete data on the needs and wants of students.</p>
    <ul class="BodyText">
        <li>The USU should continue to commit to the democratisation of information by continuing efforts of transparency</li>
        <li>The USU should investigate and engage in feedback mechanisms where the needs and wants of students can be quickly gauged</li>
    </ul>

<p class="Section">Disabilities: Disabilities Competency Training</p>
    <p class="BodyText">The joint report by the NUS, ALSA, and AMSA on the state of disability in higher education paints a grim view on how disabled students at university are underserved and disadvantaged. At our own university, we have finally begun to move off from the administrative ping-pong of the opening of our disabilities space, to be slated for opening next semester. It is appalling that higher education as a whole in Sydney has a lack of connection to the disabilities sector, indeed Sydney is one of the few areas where there is no National Disabilities Coordination Officer (NDCO). As a student organisation we need to do our part to help bridge this gap by first demanding that our student representatives and leaders be better equipped to serve the needs of those with disabilities.</p>
    <ul class="BodyText">
        <li>The USU should mandate that the board and clubs & society executives undergo disabilities awareness training</li>
        <li>The USU should commit to aiding students with disabilities wherever possible</li>
    </ul>

<p class="Section">Disabilities: Commitment to Hybrid Learning</p>
    <p class="BodyText">Hybrid learning provides equity for students who cannot (always) make it to campus, said students are often students with disabilities, carer roles, low SES, regional students, etc. In other words, marginalised sections of the student body. As a student organisation we should commit to standing for their right to education. It is vitally important that the USU take a firm stance on this issue so that we may advocate for marginalised sections of our community.</p>
    <ul class="BodyText">The USU should take a firm stance on the University committing to hybrid learning such that most marginalised sections of the student body are not disproportionately affected</ul>

<p class="Section">Cultural Competency Training</p>
    <p class="BodyText">While the USU currently maintains a suite of student leader training programs for clubs and society executives it has no current program for cultural competency training. If we are to achieve any form of justice, particuarly for Indigenous Australians, on our campus our student leaders should be equipped with the necessary tools to be culturally sensitive. 
    </p>
    <ul class="BodyText">
        <li>The USU should mandate that the board and clubs & society executives undergo cultural competency training</li>
    </ul>

<p class="Section">Commitment to Abolishing VSU</p>
    <p class="BodyText">As students we <em>should</em> be part of our student union and feel that our input is valued and that we do have control over our experiences at university. We are not mere consumers of higher education. We should actively be part of higher education and we should demand the change and action necessary to better our experiences here. This is tremendously difficult under the current system of voluntary student unionism (VSU) where the funding for student unions are determined by the whims of university management. Where student money can return to student hands we would undoubtedly see a strengthened student union in both the USU and SRC. </p>
    <ul class="BodyText">
        <li>The USU should stand firmly against VSU</li>
        <li>The USU supports on the NUS platform of a minion 50% SSAF for student organisations</li>
        <li>The USU should extend on the NUS platform and demand for 100% SSAF for student organisations</li>
    </ul>

<p class="Section">Solidarity with Staff Strikes</p>
    <p class="BodyText">As a student union it is vitally important that we stand with the NTEU and the university staff. We should <em>never</em> repeat the disaster of the previous year where the USU disregarded the board vote to shut down the USU in solidarity with the NTEU’s industrial action and chose to continue operations on the days of industrial action.</p>
    <ul class="BodyText">
        <li>The USU should stand in solidarity with the NTEU and university staff</li>
        <li>The USU should shut down operations on days of industrial action and USU staff that would otherwise be working should also be adequately paid</li>
    </ul>
